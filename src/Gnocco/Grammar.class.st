	"Now, we must compute the minimum cost of expanding a non terminal, and the minimum cost of"
	"expanding a non terminal with a certain rule. The cost constraints can be expressed with"
	"the following, mutually recursive set of equations:"
	" cost(T) = 1+min(max(cost(T_i) for i in [1, n]) for T -> T_1, ..., T_n)"
	"   where T spans over all non terminals, and T -> T_1, ..., T_n over all production rules"
	" cost(a) = 0   where a spans over all terminals"
	"To compute a solution to this system of equations, we note that its solutions are the"
	"fixpoints of a monotone operator, [stuff]Â¸ so we iterate the operator until we find"
	"a fixpoint."
	"However, in this case, because we are looking for the minimum cost, we can actually iterate"
	"only twice! This is because, in the first iteration, we will already find all the correct"
	"costs for the terminals and non terminals, because the minimum cost will not happen in a"
	"derivation that involves expanding the same non terminal twice in a path from the root of"
	"the derivation tree."
